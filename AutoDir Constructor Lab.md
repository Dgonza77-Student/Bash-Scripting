# Bash Scripting

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a script that generates a specific directory structure within a directory specified by the user. The user can supply the directory as an argument when running the script. If no argument is provided, the script will prompt the user for a directory location.

### Skills Learned

- Improved understanding of Bash script functions.
- Practical experience with the `mkdir` command for creating directories.
- Using conditional statements (`if`, `else`) to handle user input.
- Working with arguments passed to a script and prompting for input when necessary.

### Tools Used

- Oracle VM Virtual Box
- Linux
- Vim
- Bash
  
## Features

- The script allows the user to create a structured set of directories, including subdirectories.
- If the user provides a directory as an argument, the structure will be created in that location.
- If no argument is given, the script prompts the user for input.
